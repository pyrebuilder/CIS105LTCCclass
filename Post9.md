## For this blog entry we will be discussing the experience of completing the tryhackme intro to Nessus.

### Overall Impressions

Nessus is a powerful tool that allows for examining the base network security of a target. Of course, this won't show you problems like specific vulnerabilities in code/communication, bad passwords, and hardware vulnerabilities, but it is a good way to check for vulnerabilities that may be visible in a brute force network attack.

### Specific Gripes

Sadly Nessus, like most good tools, is made by people that would very much like to be compensated for their work. This makes perfect sense, but it is also a detriment to the common folk and people early on in their IT career, who might want to have access to the full tools, but who don't have the funds to sign up for all the paid tools out there in the world.

### Benefits

The benefits of this are clear. You can tell at a glance when you're leaving open ports and exposed communication methods for people to use, and anyone who knows the internet should know the risks that poses.
