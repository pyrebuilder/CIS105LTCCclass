###For this blog entry we will be defining a variety of "business documents" which are related to the class.

#First we have RFP, a Request For Proposal.
Essentially, a RFP is the document which outlines what a business wants to have done, before the specifics or methods can be outlined by bidders who provide proposals.
The process for beginning a project has to start somewhere, and usually before the point where the actual people doing the project are present. When a RFP is created, it will contain the outline of the project, it's goals, and of course the information regarding the organization sponsering it. After this point, it is posted publicly to solicit proposals.

#An MOU, Memorandum Of Understanding, or Letter of Intent, is essentially a formalized agreement.
This document takes all the aspects of informal agreements, and formalizes them. Any future actions that need to be taken, exchanges agreed upon, or legal actions would be outlined explicitly.

#A Master Service Agreement is a more detailed agreement which outlines all of the potential aspects of a business relationship.
This document attempts to outline as many details as possible. You may see it include physical and network access, how purchase orders will be made and paid, and all aspects of the business operations as they pertain to a given business relationship. The detail contained within will also allow future contracts to be negotiated more easily.

#Next we have the Statement Of Work, or SOW.
This is the response to the Master Service Agreement, from the perspective of the group responsible for completing the project. It must include all the details as to how the work will be done, what it will include, and anything else pertinent to the job. This is also the point where the units of work and general cost are first outlined in real numbers instead of estimates.

#An SLA, or Service Level Agreement, is more commonly used between a business and it's customers, rather than two businesses on the same level of cooperation.
In this document, the customer is given the specifics of what their service will include. This can take many forms depending on the service in question. The user or customer should check it carefully before accepting to make sure it meets their needs.

#Finally we have the Master License Agreement.
A MAster License Agreement usually does not include work or a business relationship. Instead it is focused on allowing a specific use of a given software, copyright, copyrighted work, or other thing that would have a licensing right held by one entity, rather than being public use. In many cases an MLA would also include a fee paid to the copyright holder in order to facilitate the agreement.
