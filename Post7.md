## For this blog entry I will share my difficulties with network addressing!

So first we have smaller network sizes. Naturally it's an odd size, and a bit difficult for me to plot out the addresses since whenever I've worked with IP address blocks, I've just been given the IP block pre-made, not had to calculate it from scratch.

Then... comes the /10 block address which is... much more difficult. I have never handled IP addresses in this size, and I was thoroughly baffled by three versions of it in a row.

I have to say, I didn't expect to have as much trouble as I did. I need to spend a lot more time re-learning about this aspect of networking if I'm going to be a networking expert.
