    EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) - An advanced distance-vector protocol developed by Cisco that combines some of the features of a link-state protocol and so is sometimes referred to as a hybrid protocol.
    exterior router - A router that directs data between autonomous systems, for example, routers used on the Internet’s backbone.
    FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocol) - A hop redundancy protocol that is designed to provide redundancy to the gateway router within the organization’s network by the use of a virtual IP address and virtual MAC address.

    giant - Packets that exceed the medium’s maximum packet size.
    GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) - An open standard for cellular networks that uses digital communication of data separated by time slots on a channel.
    HFC (hybrid fiber coaxial) - A physical infrastructure where fiber-optic cabling connects the cable company’s distribution center to distribution hubs and then to optical nodes near customers; either fiber-optic or coaxial cable then connects a node to each customer’s business or residence.
    hybrid routing protocol - A routing protocol that exhibits characteristics of both distance-vector and link-state routing protocols.
    IGP (interior gateway protocol) - A type of routing protocol, such as OSPF and IS-IS, used by core routers and edge routers within autonomous systems.
    interconnection - A point where two systems are connected to eachother.
    interior router - A router that directs data between networks within the same autonomous system. Also called core router.
    IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) - A link-state routing protocol that uses a bestpath algorithm. IS-IS was originally codified by ISO, which referred to routers as “intermediate systems,” thus the protocol’s name.
    leased line - 
    link-state routing protocol - A type of routing protocol that enables routers to share information beyond neighboring routers, after which each router can independently map the network and determine the best path between itself and a message’s destination node.
    local loop - The part of a phone system that connects a customer site with a telecommunications carrier’s switching facility.
    long-haul connection - A connection that covers a loooong stretch without inturruption, like the undersea cables!
    LTE (Long-Term Evolution) - A 4G cellular network technology that, in its latest version (called LTEAdvanced), can theoretically offer 1 Gbps throughput, although actual speeds are significantly less.
    LTE-A (LTE-Advanced) - The latest version of LTE, with theoretical downlink rates of up to 1 Gbps and uplink rates up to 100 Mbps, although actual speeds are significantly less.
    modem - A modulation/demodulation device that converts between digital and analog signals.
    MON (metropolitan optical network) - 
    MPLS (multiprotocol label switching) - A type of switching that enables multiple types of Layer 3 protocols to travel over any one of several connectionoriented Layer 2 protocols.
    OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) - An IGP and link-state routing protocol that makes up for some of the limitations of RIP and can coexist with RIP on a network.

    QoS (quality of service) - A group of techniques for adjusting the priority a network assigns to various types of transmissions.
    RIP (Routing Information Protocol) - The oldest routing protocol that is still widely used. RIP is a distance-vector protocol that uses hop count as its routing metric and allows up to only 15 hops.
    RIPv2 (Routing Information Protocol, version 2) - An updated version of the original RIP routing protocol that generates less broadcast traffic and functions more securely than its predecessor. However, RIPv2’s packet forwarding is still limited to a maximum 15 hops.
    route - A path data takes.
    routing cost - A value assigned to a particular route as judged by the network administrator; the more desirable the path, the lower its cost.
    routing loop - A situation where data loops through a network repeatedly without being able to reach a destination.
    routing metric - Properties of a route used by routing protocols to determine the best path to a destination when various paths are available. Routing metrics may be calculated using any of several variables, including hop count, bandwidth, delay, MTU, cost, and reliability.
    routing protocol - The means by which routers communicate with each other about network status. Routing protocols determine the best path for data to take between networks.
    routing table - A database stored in a router’s memory that maintains information about the location of hosts and best paths for forwarding packets to them.
