## The great list!

    3G (third generation) - Pretty widespread and standard cell network frequency.
    4G (fourth generation) - Better and faster cell network frequency, present in just about every city.
    5G (fifth generation) - Brand new form of Cell network, risk of completely destroying our weather prediction radar, faster and larger coverage range.
    active-active redundancy - A system where two identical parts function in tandem and either can fail without any interruption.
    active-passive redundancy - A system where a spare part is available to take the place of a failed part, but isn't actually functional, and likely will take a moment to come into use if a failure occurs.
    AD (administrative distance) - It's a metric used to determine a transmission protocol's reliability.
    AS (autonomous system) - A group of networks, usually operated by one organization.
    asymmetrical - Network mode where one direction of data flow is faster than the other.
    asymmetrical routing - routing to maintain an assymetric connection.
    bandwidth speed tester - A device or (more often) a website which tests how much data can be moved how quickly between two points.
    best path - The fastest route between two points.
    BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) - A vector-path routing protocol which is able to compensate for many factors and is currently considered the "protocol of the internet".
    border router - A router between two network systems, such as between an ISP and a business.
    broadband - WAN configuration of multiple customers sharing a newtork.
    cable broadband - Coax cable based internet service.
    cable modem - A device which changes a coax cable signal into an ethernet signal.
    CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) - Cell data tech which allows multiple users on a single frequency channel.
    cell site - A location where cellular broadcast equipment is mounted.
    convergence time - The time it takes for a router to recognize a best path in the event of a change or network outage.
    core router - A router that directs data between networks within the same autonomous system.
    CRC error - A case where Cyclical Redundancy Checking detects a mis-transferred or corrupted file.
    default route - A backup route, usually to another router, used when a router cannot determine a path to a messageâ€™s destination.
    DIA (dedicated Internet access) - A WAN service where the ISP equipment is not chared among customers past the backbone router.
    distance-vector routing protocol - The simplest type of routing protocols; used to determine the best route for data based on the distance to a destination.
    DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications) - An effort by Cable-Labs to standardize cable broadband service.
    DSL (digital subscriber line) - A WAN tech over telephone lines which can support data and voice over a single wire pair.
    DSL modem - A device that translates DSL single-pair signal into an Ethernet signal.
