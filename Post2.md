##For this blog entry we will be discussing the experience of completing the tryhackme intro to networking.

### Overall Impressions

A great introduction to networking and the namy models which describe it, the tryhackme website has a great format and tons of information. Overall I'm glad to have been linked to it, and to have learned the details around network design and topology.

### Specific Gripes

One of the questions is "How would you refer to data at layer 2 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model)?"
The phrase "Layer 2 of the encapsulation process" implies that it's referring to "Stage 2" of the Encapsulation process, since it says "of the encapsulation process."
Stage 2 of the Encapsulation Process, the Presentation layer header is added.
This corresponds with layer 6 of the OSI model.
"The presentation layer receives data from the application layer. This data tends to be in a format that the application understands, but it's not necessarily in a standardised format that could be understood by the application layer in the receiving computer. The presentation layer translates the data into a standardised format, as well as handling any encryption, compression or other transformations to the data. With this complete, the data is passed down to the session layer."

After a full hour of pursuing these sections of the OSI model and encapsulation process, trying many different terms to answer the question.

But I have learned I am a relatively stupid person when rote memorization and interpreting oddly worded questions is needed.

Finally, I realized that the actual question was "How would you refer to the data in layer 6 of the encapsulation process?"

### Benefits

The details regarding the encapsulation and stages of the transfer of data were completely new to me, and I'm happy to finally understand the multiple stages of DNS referral as well!
