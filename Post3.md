## For this blog entry we will be discussing the experience of completing the tryhackme intro to cryptography.

### Overall Impressions

Cryptography is a vastly complex and theory-dense subject which requires an intuitive understanding of mathematics and at least one programming language to put into practice, but the central ideas of which can be understood by most laypeople when given the proper information and guidance.

### Specific Gripes

This exercise has a few sections where it recommends going through the process of decrypting keys. This process can take quite a bit of time for someone who struggles with linux or who isn't focusing well, as you'll need to have a linux machine or VM, download the key, and perform the exercise before you can see it work. This isn't terrible but it can feel overwhelming at times.

### Benefits

This exercise gave me an excellent overview of encryption, cryptography, and the practical implimentations of the technology. I learned quite a bit! It's just hard to put it all into words since so much of it is theory.
