This is a blog page to document my experience in the Lake Tahoe Community College Computer Information Sciences 105 class, Network+.

### Who I am

My name is Erica, I'm the hardware and network tech for Sierra at Tahoe ski resort in South Lake Tahoe. We're a small IT team of three people, and if I want to move up I'm either going to become a sysadmin or the IT department manager, so I've begun the long process of learning enough to fill one of those shoes in the future.
