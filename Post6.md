## For this blog entry I will discuss the GoHackMe Active Reconnaissance room.

This was another one of those beautiful lessons where I've already seen and used the technology and commands involved extensively. Traceroute is a great way to find cables to troubleshoot or figure out which devices are overloaded in the network, ping is of course a great way to see what is out there and what it is doing, and though I've used SSH more than Telnet, I've use both quite a bit.

It's interesting to see it all explained in the lesson and the use examples outlined, when my use cases have been so different, but really it's not like I have an average experience. In the past I've used Tracert to see whether network latency in a satellite connection was normal or due to a specific device or connection.

The web browser tools were new to me though, and I went through those parts of the lesson slowly, finally understanding some of the screens I'd seen before but not understood! I also installed Wappalyzer for Firefox on my desktop, since I like being able to see what software is hosting different websites.
