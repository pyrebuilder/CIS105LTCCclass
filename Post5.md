## For this blog entry I will discuss the configuration of SOHO routers.

I've spent a lot of time configuring SOHO routers (and modems with similar config screens) throughout my career. My first introduction to them was when working as DSL tech support for AT&T.

The DSL service had an option to come with an all-in-one router/modem combo, and the configuration for that device was the first I'd ever tried. It had a hidden admin page, default and changeable passwords, and the ability to configure static IPs and multiple WLANs.

Since then, I've worked on a much wider variety, TPlink showing up often but also using cisco, linksys, sonicwall, and asus brand routers.

So far my biggest blind spot is with firewalls, struggling with the complex routing, vLAN, and traffic rules they provide. But I'm still learning!
